# HomeLab 🏡 with Terraform, Ansible and MicroK8s 

## Overview
This project aims to set up a HomeLab environment using virtualization and automation tools. It includes the deployment of a virtual machine running Ubuntu, where necessary software and services will be installed using Ansible. The project also involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster using MicroK8s to facilitate container orchestration and management.

## Objectives
 - Automate VM Deployment: Use a hypervisor to create and configure a virtual machine running Ubuntu.
 - Ansible Configuration: Utilize Ansible playbooks to automate the installation and configuration of essential software and services on the VM.
 - MicroK8s Setup: Deploy a lightweight Kubernetes cluster using MicroK8s to enable containerized applications and microservices management.
 - Learning and Experimentation: Provide a platform for experimenting with DevOps practices, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code (IaC) methodologies.
